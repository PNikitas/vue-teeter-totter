# Insider’s Teeter Totter

---

In this project, we expect you to create a standing in balance teeter totter.

- At the right side of teeter totter, there will be randomly placing objects with random weights. On the left side, there will be nothing but there will be objects falling from top to bottom. According to weight on the sides, teeter totter will be bending towards to heavy side.
- You will be managing those object’s placement by arrow keys to keep teeter totter on balance.
- Your task is, keeping this balance as much as you can.

## Rules:

- The **width** of teeter totter will be **10m**. - _Done_
- There will be **three** different **object type** with different weights. Triangle, circle and rectangle. - _Done_
- **On the left side**, only falling objects can be placed. You will be controlling objects **with arrow keys**. The placement of objects should keep balance as its best. - _Done_
- **On the right side**, there will be randomly placing objects, which created randomly and placed randomly. - _Done_
- The weights will be **between 1 and 10**. - _Done_
- The bending speed will be increasing or decreasing according to balance. - _Done_
- The **maximum bending percentage is %30**, if it exceeds this limit, simulation ends. - _Done_
- If there is extra **20kgm**(10kg * 2m) on the one side, simulation ends immediately. - _Done_
- Distance from center will be considered as factor when placing the objects to keep teeter totter on balance. - _Done_
- There will be **pause** and continue **feature**. The simulation can be paused and can be resumed last paused state. - _Done_
- Vuex store usage expected. - _Done_
- Component design expected. - _Done_
- You can use any color or styling. - _Done_

## Bonus:

- The size of the boxes will be determined by its weight. - _Done_
- The boxes may placed one upon another regardless of its type. - _Done_
- The drop speed of boxes may increase as the time goes on. - _Done_
- Auto mode: Instead of user control, the simulation will play itself. The boxes will be placed automatically without user control. - _Done_
- There can be shatter effect at the end of simulation. You are free to choose effect.
